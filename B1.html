    <h2 style="color: yellow;">What is CSS?</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">
        Casading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
    </p>
    <div style="color: red;">
        With CSS, you can control the color, the size, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements
        are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, diffrent displays for different
        devices and screen
        sizes, and much more!
        </div>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            <b>Tip:</b> the word <b>casading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will
            also apply to all children elements with the parent. So, if you
            set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text
            elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
